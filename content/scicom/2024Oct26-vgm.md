We discussed with the audience of school children about the diversity of microbes in our environment  and all the places they are found from our hands, to the TV set to our stomach. We talked about the importance of the ‘good’ microbes and the risks of the ‘bad’ ones. We introduced a pipetting challenge for kids, showing them how to use pipettes and multi-chanel pipettes using blue-dye. We had a demonstration of an Oxford Nanopore MinIon running to show how sequencing has become affordable and convinient.

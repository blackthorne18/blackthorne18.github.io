I gave a talk at the Pint of Science event talking about plasmids and their superpowers at the Ship & Mitre, Liverpool. My talk centered around how we can study the spread of antibiotic resistance by studying the spread of plasmids. Talking about plasmids as spreaders of super powers in the bacterial community, I spoke about the research I am/would be doing during my PhD.

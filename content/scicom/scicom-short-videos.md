<h2>Communicate Your Science Workshop</h2>
> April 4th 2025

I attended the Communicate Your Science, 2-4th April 2025, organised by the Genetics Society at Chichely Hall, UK. On Day 3, we were given guidance and instructions on making short form videos, and given a couple of hours to plan and shoot our own. This was my attempt, talking about how plasmids shaped the Black Plague.

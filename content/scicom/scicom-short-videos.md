<h2>Communicate Your Science Workshop</h2>
> April 4th 2025

I attended the Communicate Your Science, 2-4th April 2025, organised by the Genetics Society at Chichely Hall, UK. 
On the second day, I performed a stand up routing talking about my work studying plasmids and their compatibility with bacteria that can host them.

On the final day, we were given guidance and instructions on making short form videos, and given a couple of hours to plan and shoot our own. This was my attempt, talking about how plasmids shaped the Black Plague.

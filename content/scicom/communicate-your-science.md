title: Communicate Your Science Workshop
summary: The CYS workshop included a lot of fun activites to hone our SciCom skills. What better way to do this than standup and a TikTok reel.

<h2>Communicate Your Science Workshop</h2>
>April 4th 2025

I attended the Communicate Your Science, 2-4th April 2025, organised by the Genetics Society at Chichely Hall, UK. 

On day 2, things got exciting. We were going to be performing a stand up set on our research or our experiences in science. Helen Keen, a professional stand up comedian, walked us through how we would do this. We were shown a clip of Prof. Jonathan Pettit's Brightclub performance, which set a pretty high bar. Helen did an excellent job of easing out the nerves and giving us the tools to write our routines. We had a couple of hours to write some jokes. It was scary going up to speak, wondering whether or not the jokes will land. I had fun writing the jokes so I felt I was content with that session already.

The last session shifted the focus to making short form videos. The rise of Tiktok, Instagram Reels, has bolstered the way we consume media, science communication being a rising part of that. Dr. Sally Le Page, walked us through the nuts and bolts of film making, teaching us about writing, filming and editing videos. We were told about how to plan our shoots from lighting considerations, to capturing clear sound, ways to keep the video professional and clean. Importantly we were told what can be edited in post, so that we need not fret about it, and what cannot be edited in post, and we need to take special consideration for during the planning stage. This was my attempt after a fun two hour walk around the beuatiful Chicheley Hall.

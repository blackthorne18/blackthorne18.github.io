We discussed with the audience of school children about the diversity of microbes in our environment  and all the places they are found from our hands, to the TV set to our stomach. We talked about the importance of the ‘good’ microbes and the risks of the ‘bad’ ones. Kids were encouraged to draw and create their own microbes, name them and give them 'superpowers'. We had microscopes on display to showcase the diversity of microbes that can be found out in a garden.

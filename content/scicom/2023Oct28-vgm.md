We discussed with the audience of school children about the diversity of microbes in our environment  and all the places they are found from our hands, to the TV set to our stomach. We talked about the importance of the ‘good’ microbes and the risks of the ‘bad’ ones. We had cultured plates of swabs from various places that were Harry Potter themed ex: “Mr. Weasley's Car”. We had microscopes focusing on drops of puddle water showcasing protozoa, cyanobacteria and algal diversity.
